Understanding pricing models helps you:

## Common SaaS Pricing Models

### 1. Per-User Pricing

**How It Works:**

Pay a fixed price per user per month/year.

**Example:** $15/user/month

**Variations:**

- **Active users**: Only pay for those who log in
- **Named users**: Pay per assigned seat
- **Concurrent users**: Pay for simultaneous users

**Pros:**

- Simple and predictable
- Scales with team growth
- Easy to budget
- Fair for small teams
- Clear value proposition

**Cons:**

- Expensive for large teams
- Discourages broad adoption
- Can penalize growth
- Users may share accounts (against TOS)
- Not ideal for fluctuating teams

**Best For:**

- Collaboration tools (Slack, Asana)
- Project management software
- Communication platforms
- Tools with per-person value

**Negotiation Tips:**

- Ask for volume discounts
- Negotiate annual pricing
- Request inactive user provisions
- Lock in rates for multi-year

**Example Tools:**

- Slack: $7.25-12.50/user/month
- Asana: $10.99-24.99/user/month
- Zoom: $14.99-19.99/user/month

### 2. Tiered Pricing

**How It Works:**

Multiple plans with increasing features and limits.

**Example Structure:**

**Best For:**

- Broad customer base
- Products with clear feature sets
- Businesses needing flexibility
- Companies with different needs by size

**Choosing Your Tier:**

**Evaluate:**

1. Required features
2. User limits
3. Storage needs
4. Support level
5. Integration requirements

**Avoid:**

- Paying for unused features
- Under-buying and hitting limits
- Frequent tier changes

**Example Tools:**

### 3. Usage-Based Pricing

**How It Works:**

Pay based on consumption (API calls, storage, transactions, etc.)

**Metrics:**

### 4. Freemium

**How It Works:**

Free basic version, paid premium features.

**Models:**

- **Feature-limited**: Free has fewer features

- **Time-limited**: Free trial then paid
- **Support-limited**: Free has basic support only

**Pros:**

- No risk to start
- Easy to adopt
- Can use free forever
