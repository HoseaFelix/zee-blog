Investing can feel intimidating. This guide breaks it down into simple actions you can take today to start growing wealth responsibly.

## Start with goals and horizon

Ask yourself:

- What am I investing for? (retirement, home, education)
- When will I need the money? (time horizon)
- What is my risk tolerance?

Your answers determine asset allocation. Longer horizons allow more equity exposure.

## Choose the right account

- Tax-advantaged: 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA — use these when available
- Taxable brokerage: flexible for goals without contribution limits

Maximize employer match in retirement plans first — it's free money.

## Prefer low-cost, diversified funds

For most beginners, low-cost index funds or ETFs are ideal:

- Broad-market index funds (Total Market, S&P 500)
- Bond index funds for stability
- Consider target-date funds for hands-off investing

Costs matter: an expense ratio gap of 0.5% compounded over decades materially affects outcomes.

## Simple starter portfolio (example)

- 80% US total stock market index fund
- 15% international stock index fund
- 5% short-term bond fund (or cash) — adjust for risk tolerance

Rebalance annually and increase contributions over time.

## Dollar-cost averaging and contributions

Regular contributions smooth market timing risks. Automate monthly transfers.

## Avoid common beginner mistakes

- Chasing hot stocks or trying to time the market
- Paying high fees (active funds with high expense ratios)
- Ignoring diversification (only one sector or single stock)

## Next steps

1. Open (or log into) a brokerage or retirement account.
2. Set automatic contributions (even a small amount).
3. Buy a low-cost total market index fund and hold for the long term.

Investing is a long-term habit. Start small, keep costs low, and stay consistent.
